<p><b>[ABOUT]</b></p>

<p><b>About the Data</b></p>

<p>The <i>GPO Congressional Hearings Search Engine </i>is capable of mining the full text of more than 20,000 hearings (1997- present) of Senate, House, joint, or special committee meetings of Congress published by the <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/browse/collection.action?collectionCode=CHRG&amp;browsePath=105&amp;isCollapsed=false&amp;leafLevelBrowse=false&amp;ycord=0">U. S. Government Publishing Office</a> (GPO). </p>

<br />
<p>The Congressional hearings for this project are harvested from the GPO site on a weekly basis. According to the GPO, not all of the congressional hearings are available since it is ultimately up to the committee to publish them. </p>

<p><b>About the Search Engine</b></p>

<p>The <i>GPO Congressional Hearings Search Engine</i> was developed by OU Libraries using Elasticsearch, a RESTful search and analytics engine, that along with conducting standard keyword searches, allows exact phrase, proximity, partial word searching, and filtering options. (github link?)</p>
